        <td>Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable (UTP) is the most common type of cable used in networks. Almost all Ethernet LANs are built using UTP cables. UTP cables are thin and flexible and very cost effective which makes them the ideal choice for Ethernet cabling. The EIA/TIA (Electronic Industry Association/Telecommunication Industry Association) has established standards of UTP and rated various categories of wire some of which are shown below.

        <td> Shielded Twisted Pair Cable (STP) </td>
        <td><img src="img/32.PNG"></td>
        <td> Shielded Twisted Pair Cable (STP) wraps each pair of wire in a metallic foil and further wraps all four pairs if wires in a metallic braid or foil, this further reduces the noise both within the cable from outside the cable. STP cable is more expensive then UTP cable and is much more difficult to install and manage. It also requires grounding at both ends of the metallic shield.

        <td> Coxial cable is the most popular cable in cable television industry, a coaxial cable consists of copper conductor which is surrounded by an insulation material, over the insulation material is copper braid or foil that acts both as the second wire in the circuit and as a shield for the inner conductor thereby protecting it from interference. The coaxial cable is difficult to install and manage but it can support much greater cable lengths.

        <td>Fiber-Optic cable </td>
        <td><img src="img/35.PNG"></td>
        <td>Fiber-Optic cable is made up of glass and plastic fibers surrounded by several layers of protective materials. Fiber-optic cables are much more expensive than twisted-pair and coaxial cables. Fiber-optic cables are immune to EMI and can run small and large distances depending upon the type of cable. Fiber-optic cables support very high bandwidth which makes them the preferred choice of cables when high speed connectivity is required.
